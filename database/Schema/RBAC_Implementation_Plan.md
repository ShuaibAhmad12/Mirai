# RBAC Implementation Plan for Alpine Education System

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation plan for the Alpine Education Management System, covering all user types including students, staff, administrators, and external users.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Users Table** - Central user registry with Supabase auth integration
2. **Roles Table** - Hierarchical role definitions with privilege levels
3. **Permissions Table** - Granular permissions with resource-operation mapping
4. **Profile Tables** - Type-specific user profiles (Staff, Student, External)
5. **Assignment Tables** - Many-to-many mappings for roles and permissions

### Key Features

- ✅ **Hierarchical Role System** (Level 1-100)
- ✅ **Granular Permissions** (Resource + Operation based)
- ✅ **Multi-Scope Support** (Global, College, Department, Course, Self)
- ✅ **Temporal Role Assignments** (Expiration support)
- ✅ **Soft Delete & Audit Trail**
- ✅ **Supabase Integration** (RLS + Auth)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Database Setup

```sql
-- Deploy the RBAC schema
\i 007_rbac_user_management.sql

-- Create initial system admin
INSERT INTO users (supabase_auth_id, email, first_name, last_name, status, is_system_admin)
VALUES ('AUTH_UUID', 'admin@alpine.edu', 'System', 'Admin', 'ACTIVE', TRUE);
```

### Supabase Integration

1. **Auth Integration** - Link users.supabase_auth_id to auth.users.id
2. **RLS Policies** - Implement row-level security for data access
3. **API Access** - Use helper functions for permission checking

### Next.js Frontend Integration

```typescript
// Example permission checking hook
const usePermissions = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();

  const hasPermission = useCallback(
    async (resource: string, operation: string) => {
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc("user_has_permission", {
        p_user_id: user.id,
        p_resource_type: resource,
        p_operation: operation,
      });
      return data;
    },
    [user]
  );

  return { hasPermission };
};
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication

- ✅ Supabase Auth integration
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication support
- ✅ Session management

### Authorization

- ✅ Hierarchical role-based access
- ✅ Granular permission system
- ✅ Scope-based restrictions
- ✅ Temporal access controls

### Data Protection

- ✅ Row-level security (RLS)
- ✅ Audit trails for all changes
- ✅ Soft delete for data retention
- ✅ Encrypted sensitive fields

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring

- Index optimization for user lookups
- Permission checking query performance
- Role assignment query efficiency
- Audit log management

### Regular Maintenance

- Role assignment reviews (quarterly)
- Permission audit (semi-annually)
- Inactive user cleanup (monthly)
- Performance optimization (ongoing)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review and approve** the RBAC schema design
2. **Deploy** 007_rbac_user_management.sql to development environment
3. **Create** initial system admin user
4. **Test** basic authentication and authorization flows

### Development Priorities

1. **Staff Profile Migration Script** - Transform existing staff data
2. **Student User Linking** - Connect students to user accounts
3. **Permission Management UI** - Administrative interface
4. **Role Assignment Workflows** - Automated and manual processes

### Future Enhancements
